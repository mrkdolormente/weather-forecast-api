# Weather Forecast App

This project is develop to easily monitor and access weather updates within the specific location of the user choice. It is build and design in angular framework as the client-side and node.js for the server-side. Click here to know more about [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Get Started

The back-end service is running using Express.js as framework and PostgreSQL as the database.

### Clone the Repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mrkdolormente/weather-forecast-api.git
cd weather-forecast-api
```

### Install npm packages

```shell
npm install
```

### Development server

Run `npm start` command to run the development server locally. After running the dev server, open [postman](https://www.postman.com/) and create a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files with the use of [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).

### Database

Since the application is using PostgreSQL as database, you need to install PostgreSQL in your local environment to run it locally. Download PostgreSQL [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Env

Rename the `local.env` to `.env` and assign a value to the required properties
